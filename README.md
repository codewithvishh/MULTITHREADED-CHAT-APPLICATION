DURATION: 4 WEEKS
MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH
DESCRIPTION: IN THIS TASK, THE GOAL IS TO BUILD A REAL-TIME CHAT APPLICATION WHERE MULTIPLE USERS (CLIENTS) CAN COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER THROUGH A CENTRALIZED SERVER USING JAVA SOCKETS AND 
             MULTITHREADING. 
             THE SERVER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HANDLING MULTIPLE CLIENT CONNECTIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY, WHILE EACH CLIENT SENDS AND RECEIVES MESSAGES IN REAL-TIME.
             I DID FOLLOWING STEPS IN THE TASK,
             1) CREATE A SERVER THAT LISTENS FOR CLIENT CONNECTIONS.
             2) MANAGE MULTIPLE CLIENTS CONCURRENTLY USING MULTITHREADING.
             3) ALLOW CLIENTS TO CHAT WITH EACH OTHER BY SENDING MESSAGES THAT ARE BROADCAST TO ALL CONNECTED CLIENTS.
             4) IMPLEMENT COMMUNICATION USING JAVA SOCKETS (WHICH ALLOW CLIENTS AND THE SERVER TO COMMUNICATE OVER A NETWORK).
             5) BUILD A REAL-TIME CHAT INTERFACE FOR CLIENTS TO SEND AND RECEIVE MESSAGES.
             FOR BUILDING THIS APPLICATION I USED ECLIPSE IDE.
